# Apple Product Page clone

This is a simple, static webpage built with HTML and CSS that clones a iPhone product page from Apple Website

I have created div elements for product cards, image cards, the primary buttons for user-actions - these can be easily tweaked when you fork this and you can play around with the styling using the css sheet 

# Usage

All the images used in the webpage are taken from Apple website and only used for the purpose of practice. 

# License

There is no licensing needed to use this. Feel free to give credit when you fork it.
